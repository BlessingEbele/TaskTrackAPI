"# TaskTrack API" 
'''Step 1: Define Data Models and Relationships
The core functionality of TaskTrack API involves managing tasks and users. Here's how we can structure the models:

1. User Model
Extend Djangoâ€™s AbstractUser for customizations if needed.
Fields: username, email, password, date_joined, etc.
2. Task Model
Fields:
title (string): The title of the task.
description (text): A detailed description.
status (boolean): Whether the task is complete or not.
due_date (date): Optional deadline.
created_at and updated_at (timestamps).
user (foreign key): Link each task to a user.

Step 3: Outline API Endpoints
Endpoint	Method	Functionality
/api/tasks/	GET	List all tasks for the authenticated user.
/api/tasks/	POST	Create a new task.
/api/tasks/<id>/	GET	Retrieve a specific task.
/api/tasks/<id>/	PUT/PATCH	Update a specific task.
/api/tasks/<id>/	DELETE	Delete a specific task.
/api/tasks/<id>/status/	PATCH	Mark a task as complete/incomplete.

"""

"""
Step 5: Test the API Endpoints
Use Postman or cURL to test the endpoints locally.
Verify CRUD operations work for tasks and users.
